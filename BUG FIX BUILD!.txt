I get the same error, for a couple of weeks now, when trying to run an app from the master channel.

I got it working by forcing the web renderer to be HTML:

flutter run -d chrome --no-sound-null-safety --web-renderer=html
When you build your app for web you should:

flutter build web --no-sound-null-safety --web-renderer=html
By default the web renderer is auto, choosing the canvaskit web renderer on desktop browsers and html on mobile.

If you want to avoid this altogether you can stay on the beta or dev channels.
